            Quantum computing is based on quantum mechanics, which governs how nature works at the smallest scales. The smallest classical computing element is a bit, which can be either 0 or 1. The quantum equivalent is a qubit, which can also be 0 or 1 or in what's called a superposition — any combination of 0 and 1. Performing a calculation on two classical bits (which can be 00, 01, 10 and 11) requires four calculations. A quantum computer can perform calculations on all four states simultaneously. This scales exponentially: 1,000 qubits would, in some respects, be more powerful than the world's most powerful supercomputer.

The promise of quantum computing, however, is not speeding up conventional computing. Rather, it will deliver an exponential advantage for certain classes of problems, such as factoring very large numbers, with profound implications for cybersecurity.

Qubits, however, are inherently unstable. Interaction between a qubit and its surroundings degrades information in microseconds. Isolating qubits from the environment, for example, by cooling them close to absolute zero, is challenging and expensive. Noise increases with qubit count, requiring complex error correction approaches.

The other quantum concept central to quantum computing is entanglement, whereby qubits can become correlated such that they are described by a single quantum state. Measure one and you instantaneously know the state of the other. Entanglement is important in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.

            Rural development and the governance of these places is a matter that is constantly perplexing policy-makers; the issue is how to overcome uneven patterns of development [1,2] in regions with lower population densities and larger distances to markets. ‘Core/periphery’ models have dominated in regional development discourses [3,4], which focus attention and resources on developing ‘core’ areas (i.e., cities and innovation hotspots), with peripheral areas either being ‘left behind’ [5,6] or placed on the wrong side of trickle-down economics [7]. ‘Core-periphery’ logic still underlies current city-regions models of development [8] whereby the city supports the rural hinterlands. Consequentially, this has led to under-development in rural areas, and the desire to instead self-govern through decentralised forms of governance [9,10]. However, the process of decentralisation has historically been fraught with difficulties [11].

As will be explored in this paper, blockchain technology has the potential to become a new innovative mechanism for decentralised rural development and governance, and perhaps even prove a fertile environment for use-cases and innovation in this emerging industry “as the barriers to adoption are likely to be reduced and the social and economic drivers engender greater impetus for change” [12] (p.125). Blockchain technology “enables a network of participants that do not know or trust each other to agree on the state of a shared administration, without relying on human intervention, a central point of control, or regulatory supervision” [13] (p.21).

This conceptual paper aims to explore the following research question: Can blockchain technology help to overcome issues commonly associated with rural governance and development? It begins by presenting the dominant discourses in economic geography that have led rural areas to lag behind urban areas (Section 2). Following this, it explores how previous decentralised development and governance attempts have been unsuccessful (Section 3), somewhat due to the lack of appropriate mechanisms or tools to govern these initiatives. Next, in Section 4, the key characteristics of blockchain technology and use-cases for rural areas are presented. The role of blockchains in future governance systems is explored (Section 5) before considering the criticisms, limitations, and barriers to adoption (Section 6). A new model of distributed governance is proposed in the discussion (Section 7) before the conclusion provides a future research agenda and initial policy implications (Section 8).

Before continuing, it is necessary to define some of the key concepts in the paper: governance, decentralisation, and blockchain. Firstly, governance is defined as the institutional mechanisms that help two or more parties agree and enforce a decision by increasing both cooperation and coordination between them [14]. Mode 1 forms of governance are hierarchical, whereby decision-making resides at the top of a vertical hierarchy [15]. Mode 2 forms are considered more horizontal and include more actors (such as the private sector and civic society) in decision-making [15]. More recently, network-based (Mode 3) forms of governance have emerged, with power relations and decision-making being distributed across the network [15]. Mode 3 models are distinct from previous modes and require new technologies (such as blockchain technology) to facilitate them [16].

Secondly, decentralisation is a term that has multifarious meanings across different disciplines. In the development literature, decentralisation infers a process of devolution [17] whereby strategic decision-making and monetary budgets are transferred to regional governmental bodies. However, as this paper will explore, by using blockchain technology, it is perhaps better to reframe this as ‘distributed’ governance [18].

Lastly, blockchain is a new technology that operates a public ledger that is trustless, indisputable, and theoretically tamper-proof [19]. Blockchains have three key characteristics that separate them from other databases and ledgers, in that they are open, have a full and public history of transactions, and are operated through a cryptographic consensus protocol [20]. Further details about the features and operation of a blockchain are found in Sections 4 The potential of blockchain technology, 5 Governance and blockchain.

            I wake up in the middle of the night. It’s cold.

“Hey, Google, what’s the temperature in Zone 2,” I say into the darkness. A disembodied voice responds: “The temperature in Zone 2 is 52 degrees.” “Set the heat to 68,” I say, and then I ask the gods of artificial intelligence to turn on the light.

Many of us already live with A.I., an array of unseen algorithms that control our Internet-connected devices, from smartphones to security cameras and cars that heat the seats before you’ve even stepped out of the house on a frigid morning.

But, while we’ve seen the A.I. sun, we have yet to see it truly shine.

Researchers liken the current state of the technology to cellphones of the 1990s: useful, but crude and cumbersome. They are working on distilling the largest, most powerful machine-learning models into lightweight software that can run on “the edge,” meaning small devices such as kitchen appliances or wearables. Our lives will gradually be interwoven with brilliant threads of A.I.

Our interactions with the technology will become increasingly personalized. Chatbots, for example, can be clumsy and frustrating today, but they will eventually become truly conversational, learning our habits and personalities and even develop personalities of their own. But don’t worry, the fever dreams of superintelligent machines taking over, like HAL in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” will remain science fiction for a long time to come; consciousness, self-awareness and free will in machines are far beyond the capabilities of science today.

Privacy remains an issue, because artificial intelligence requires data to learn patterns and make decisions. But researchers are developing methods to use our data without actually seeing it — so-called federated learning, for example — or encrypt it in ways that currently can’t be hacked.

Our homes and our cars will increasingly be watched over with A.I.-integrated sensors. Some security cameras today use A.I.-enabled facial recognition software to identify frequent visitors and detect strangers. But soon, networks of overlapping cameras and sensors will create a mesh of “ambient intelligence,” that will be available to monitor us all the time, if we want it. Ambient intelligence could recognize changes in behavior and prove a boon to older adults and their families.

            5G is the newest mobile network being deployed worldwide. A major transformative change is underway that empowers service providers and enterprises to reshape their business models to launch innovative solutions with 5G connectivity.

It’s not just the next generation standard in cellular connectivity that would make communication better and faster. With major changes in operating bands, infrastructure, application models, and regulations, it is a paradigm shift that is set to revolutionize the industry in the upcoming decade. Advancement in 5G technology is driven by multiple wireless connectivity features that can be broadly described by the 5G Triangle

Impact of 5G Technology on Different Industries
5G is set to revolutionize the various sectors of the industry by delivering multi-Gbps data speeds, massive network capacity, and ultra-low latency for reliability and increased availability. However, this can only be achieved through the convergence of 5G connectivity development, distributed computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) services.

5G IoT Application in Consumer Market
The eMBB is certainly going to play a pivotal role in the initial phases of the 5G rollout, considering wireless broadband for mobile handhelds and fixed users in remote areas (FWA) is the primary motivation for the evolution of this technology.  With additional mmWave support, the 5G CPE is able to offer speed and reliability comparable to fiber. The ever-increasing demand for high bandwidth, high data rate for streaming HD videos, SOHO using high data traffic services, and advanced use cases like 3D gaming and augmented reality has brought 5G deployment to a necessity level.

5G IoT Application in Industrial Communication
Typical industrial applications like robotic production lines, sensor networks, and industrial plant equipment on the shop floor communicate with respective control systems over field buses that generally use a variety of protocols. Performance requirements of these links not able to connect with Wi-Fi or LTE networks. Due to the URLLC feature for 5G, the 3GPP Release-16 specification has introduced distinct 5G enablers for Industry 4.0, industrial IoT (IIoT) that incorporate 5G as a bridge to IEEE TSN, officially includes non-public networks and support for 5G-LAN type service. This is helping industrial designers to develop mobile networks that meet requirements for coverage, time-critical performance, and security aspects to achieve the expected Quality of Service (QoS). The 5G private networks are a preferred choice for industrial communication as high security and privacy requirements can be met through isolation from public mobile networks apart from the advantages of high quality of service and easier maintenance of operations.`,

“Japan should not help the tiger (U.S.), because the pain is still there. The embargo will only further inspire China’s determination to stand on its own feet,” Qin said.`,

            The Italian data-protection authority said there were privacy concerns relating to the model, which was created by US start-up OpenAI and is backed by Microsoft.

The regulator said it would ban and investigate OpenAI "with immediate effect".

OpenAI told the BBC it complied with privacy laws. Millions of people have used ChatGPT since it launched in November 2022.

It can answer questions using natural, human-like language and it can also mimic other writing styles, using the internet as it was in 2021 as its database.

Microsoft has spent billions of dollars on it and it was added to Bing last month.

It has also said that it will embed a version of the technology in its Office apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.

            Tesla shares closed down 6% on Monday after the company’s quarterly deliveries report led some investors to worry that more price cuts will be needed to drive sales, eating into margins.
            Over the weekend, Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of 422,875 electric vehicles and production of 440,808 cars. The record numbers represented 4% growth in deliveries from the prior period and followed repeated price cuts in the U.S., China and Europe.

            Some of the reductions in the U.S. were implemented in part to enable Tesla and its customers to take advantage of tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction Act. But one ongoing concern is that increased competition will force the automaker to keep lowering prices if it wants to attract buyers as new EVs continue to hit the market.

            “Many investors believe that Tesla’s recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market,” wrote Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note following the deliveries report. “We maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla’s), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down.”

            Apple CEO Tim Cook recently explained in an interview with GQ why people might want the sort of mixed reality headset his company is expected to announce in the coming months.

The notoriously secretive company has been silent on the subject, and Cook didn’t confirm or deny the headset’s existence, but Cook spelled out his thinking on arguably the biggest question mark: Why would anyone buy it?

In short: art, communication, “creative” applications, and corporate environments, Cook told GQ.

“The idea that you could overlay the physical world with things from the digital world could greatly enhance people’s communication, people’s connection,” Cook told GQ.

VR as a tool, especially for communication, isn’t a novel concept. When Meta
 CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared his vision for the Metaverse in 2021, upending how people communicated was one of the first things Zuckerberg discussed. Meta has struggled to find success with its virtual reality business, called Reality Labs.

            When you’re new to coding, it can be hard to know where to start, and it’s easy to get sucked down paths that could waste a whole lot of your time and money.

I’m Eric Elliott, author of “Programming JavaScript Applications” (O’Reilly), development team leader, JavaScript instructor, and public speaker. I teach and hire JavaScript developers. I know both sides of the market very well. Here are some of my favorite tips for aspiring coders:

Forget university programs. Unless it’s from Stanford or MIT, your degree will mean a lot less than having some apps to show off. In fact, most university programs struggle to keep up with changing technology. A degree will buy you a few thousand dollars more for the first 1–3 years. After that it makes exactly zero difference. Unless you like flushing time and money down the toilet…
Start with JavaScript. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It’s the standard language of the web platform, and it’s very commonly used to code mobile apps, too. You can even program robots, drones, and games with JavaScript.
Score a quick win right now. Confidence holds coding students back more than anything else. Get a boost by starting with something easy. Code.org has Star Wars and Minecraft hour of code curriculum designed for kids. Even if you’re an adult, it’s a great way to prove to yourself that you can do it.
The best way to learn how to code is to code. Lots of students start by reading books. It’s OK to go that route — that’s how I learned to code when I was just getting started, but if you really want to get off on the right foot, start out with some exercises. FreeCodeCamp’s 10-hour basic JavaScript track will give you a good opportunity to stretch your wings.
Learn by example. One of the best ways to score major breakthroughs is to watch somebody else code, and pick up on how they think about problems. Find a study buddy and try some pair programming. I recently started a new show called “Shotgun with Eric Elliott” — a video screencast show that lets you ride shotgun while I build real apps. I talk you through what I’m thinking with every step, and drop a lot of knowledge for you to pick up along the way. I’m journaling each episode on this blog.
Read Blogs. I may be biased, but JavaScript Scene is a great blog to subscribe to. I’m a fan of 2ality as well — a great way to stay on top of what’s coming next in the JavaScript specification.
Try a Bootcamp. If you can afford to attend school full time, forget university programs (see point 1). Try a bootcamp, instead. Bootcamps are great if you need to feel really invested (commonly $10k — $25k), and you need to be accountable to somebody other than yourself. I’ve hired bootcamp grads who had zero experience before the bootcamp. They did a great job with a little guidance from the experienced team members. Beware of bootcamps that only offer 3-month (12-week) programs. You need at least twice as much study & practice to be job-ready.
Learn Online. If you don’t have the money for a bootcamp, or you’re a more self-motivated, self-directed type, try online training. “Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott” picks up where the introductory training you’ll find many other places leaves off. A great stepping stone from entry level to senior level jobs.
Find a Strong Mentor. Graduating from a bootcamp or online course is just step one in your learning journey. At the pace this industry changes, you’ll never stop learning. You should always have a strong mentor to learn from. You don’t have to know them in-person in order to learn from them. It can be somebody you follow online.
Find a Meetup or Study Group. Meetups are a great way to find mentors, study buddies, and new friends, regardless of your current skill level. And there’s often free pizza involved. Check out Meetup.com.
Mix it up. Video lessons are great, but you need to practice to learn. Exercises are great, but typically only drill very specific concepts and leave out great coding wisdom you could learn from a video guide. In-person is great, but tends to lack structure. Books are great, but most readers don’t get enough practice from books. Whatever you’re doing, mix it up once in a while. Try to learn from more than one medium.

            This October I celebrated my 5 year anniversary working at GitHub. 🎉 5 years ago, I was an enthusiastic accountant (like straight nerd — my former twitter handle was @taxaly) who knew nothing about code, let alone about using Git and GitHub.

Now I’m an enthusiastic Data Scientist who knows a handful of things about coding using Git & GitHub. It’s partially thanks to learning these technologies that I made this rewarding career switch.

But even working at GitHub, learning Git and GitHub were hard! As it’s own form of an open source contribution, I wanted to share with other folks new to coding my top 5 tips for using GitHub.

Tip #1: Change your default text editor associated with Git
For many people, the default text editor when using Git from the terminal is VIM. VIM can be a terrible, scary thing for the new or casual hacker. Or even for veteran hackers or @haacked himself.


If you ever find yourself with a merge conflict (and you will, see tip #4), you’ll get kicked out to VIM to fix the conflict and then you’ll need to know the specific VIM commands to edit the doc and want to cry. For more than a year I had a sticky note on my monitor at work as a reminder of the basic VIM commands like i (to edit) and :wq (to save and quit). To avoid the potential tears, you could just change the default text editor.

In order to change your text editor to Atom, Sublime, or TextMate, follow the instructions in this GitHub Help.

While you are at it, you should also make sure your shortcuts are set up so you can open files in your preferred text editor directly from the terminal using subl . or atom .Check out these docs for setting up Atom access from your terminal and these docs for setting up Sublime.

Tip #2: Change your dotfiles
I didn’t learn about dotfiles until I was hacking and using Git & GitHub for multiple years. I’m still bummed that I didn’t know about this sooner!

Dotfiles allow you to customize your terminal prompt so you can see what git branch you are on & if you have uncommited changes. IT’S GENIUS! I got my dotfiles from a co-worker (
John Nunemaker
) but if you search GitHub for ‘dotfiles’ you’ll find loads of options.



dotfiles for the win!
Tip #3: Install Hub
Hub is a command line tool that makes it easier to use GitHub. Often I will be working on a repository in my terminal but want to see issues or pull requests on GitHub. So I’ll open a browser tab, then get distracted by email/twitter/a puppy — and ten minutes later, get around to typing in the GitHub repository url.

By typing hub browse in the terminal, it will auto-magically open the url of the repository directly in your browser for distraction free GitHub-ing. Boom. `,

            When I started using React, there was no Redux. There was only the Flux architecture, and about a dozen competing implementations of it.

Now there are two clear winners for data management in React: Redux and MobX, and the latter isn’t even a Flux implementation. Redux has caught on so much that it’s not just being used for React anymore. You can find Redux architecture implementations for other frameworks, including Angular 2. See ngrx:store, for example.

Side note: MobX is cool, and I’d probably choose it over Redux for simple UIs, because it’s less complicated and less verbose. That said, there are some important features of Redux that MobX doesn’t give you, and it’s important to understand what those features are before you decide what’s right for your project.

Side side note: Relay and Falcor are other interesting solutions for state management, but unlike Redux and MobX, they must be backed by GraphQL and Falcor Server, respectively, and all Relay state corresponds to some server-persisted data. AFAIK, neither offers a good story for client-side-only, transient state management. You may be able to enjoy the benefits of both by mixing and matching Relay or Falcor with Redux or MobX, differentiating between client-only state and server-persisted state. Bottom line: There is no clear single winner for state management on the client today. Use the right tool for the job at hand.

Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux made a couple great courses on the topic: 1. Understand the Benefits of Redux
There are a couple important goals for Redux that you need to keep in mind:

Deterministic View Renders
Deterministic State Reproduction
Determinism is important for application testability and diagnosing and fixing bugs. If your application views and state are nondeterministic, it’s impossible to know whether or not the views and state will always be valid. You might even say that nondeterminism is a bug in itself.

But some things are inherently nondeterministic. Things like the timing of user input and network I/O. So how can we ever know if our code really works? Easy: Isolation.

The main purpose of Redux is to isolate state management from I/O side effects such as rendering the view or working with the network. When side-effects are isolated, code becomes much more simple. It’s a lot easier to understand and test your business logic when it’s not all tangled up with network requests and DOM updates.

When your view render is isolated from network I/O and state updates, you can achieve a deterministic view render, meaning: given the same state, the view will always render the same output. It eliminates the possibility of problems such as race conditions from asynchronous stuff randomly wiping out bits of your view, or mutilating bits of your state as your view is in the process of rendering.`,

We don’t include examples in our prompts.
We ignore that we can control ChatGPT’s behavior with roles.
We let ChatGPT guess stuff instead of providing it with some information.

This happens because we mostly use standard prompts that might help us get the job done once, but not all the time.

            Google’s Bard was recently released to the public to compete with ChatGPT. Like ChatGPT, you can create posts, get your questions answered, and solve math and coding problems with Bard.

But are Bard’s responses as good as ChatGPT’s?

That’s what we’ll see in this article! We’ll compare how good both ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Bard are at reasoning, creativity, instruction understanding, and speed.
            
Roles
A good way to make the most of chatbots is with roles. Roles allow us to customize the behavior of a chatbot. It works wonders with ChatGPT, but not with Bard.

I asked both ChatGPT and Bard to act as interviewers so that I could practice interviewing for a software engineer position. ChatGPT changed its default behavior and started an interview with me, while Bard only gave the script of a job interview.

Things got worse with Bard when I asked it to act as a language partner in order to have a conversation in Spanish.
As you can see, Bard neither supports roles nor languages other than English.

            Hello, and welcome!

My name is Benoit. I have been a software engineer for the past eight and a half years. I stayed at my previous (and first) company for seven and a half years, then I joined a new one in early 2022.

This article comes from a recent self-reflection on the things I wish I had started doing earlier in my career and the things I wish I had done differently.

What I am sharing here may be useful to any junior to mid-level developer who wishes to improve and progress toward the title of senior and beyond.

My Career Evolution
Before diving into the main subject, here is my career evolution:

1. I interned for three months at a startup (which quickly became a scale-up) company.
2. After that, I did a full year of work-study, spending three months at school and nine months at work.
3. Then, I got hired as a full-time software engineer and kept this title for three and a half years.
4. Quickly after the introduction of the tech career ladder, I got promoted to senior software engineer. I kept this title for three years until I left the company, at which point the tech teams accounted for approximately 200 people.
5. I joined as a software engineer 2 at a company with thousands of tech employees. Despite the title downgrade at the second company (see Big Tech Hiring is Conservative — But Why?), I have been trying to keep the same responsibilities (and more) as before.


In the beginning, I was part of the frontend team. The tech organisation was split between backend and frontend developers. At that time, we were no more than 30 engineers. When our new CTO arrived a year later, he introduced an organisation based on feature teams: the Spotify Model. Although there was some friction at the start (people don’t like change), this reorganisation definitely turned out to be for the better.

I stayed for more than five years in the same feature team. I was there at its inception, so throughout the years, I became the tech referent of the project. Eventually, I joined another team, where I worked until I left for a whole new adventure a year later.

All right, enough with the context. I hope you’ll enjoy reading the rest, and that the following advice will be actionable for your career progression!

          OpenAI, owner of the AI chat generator, ChatGPT, which has attracted attention as an AI provider and potential Google search competitor, has said that it expects $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024 in a recent pitch to investors.

The research organisation, co-founded by Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman and backed by $1 billion in funding from Microsoft Corp, is expecting its business to surge.‌‌‌‌

The new AI chatbot has answered queries for more than 1 million users so far and can fix programming bugs and crack jokes. But some investors have expressed scepticism about the new creation, while others are betting that the underlying technology will go far beyond splashy and sometimes flawed public demos.‌‌‌‌

OpenAI was most recently valued at $20 billion in a secondary share sale, news sources said. The startup has already inspired rivals and companies building applications atop its generative AI software, which includes the image maker DALL-E 2.‌‌`,

            Twitter has laid off at least 200 staff in another round of cuts, according to reports in the New York Times.

It said the tech giant had cut 10% of its current workforce, which it estimated at 2,000 people.

This is the latest round of job losses at Twitter since chief executive Elon Musk sacked about 50% of its 7,500 employees when he took over in October.

As staff learned of their fate, Mr Musk tweeted: "Hope you have a good Sunday. First day of the rest of your life."

Esther Crawford, chief executive of Twitter Payments, who oversaw the Twitter Blue verification subscription model, said she was "deeply proud of my team" in a tweet after being among those released.

And senior product manager Martijn de Kuijper, who founded newsletter tool Revue which Twitter acquired in 2021, said he found out he had lost his job after being locked out of his work emails.

      Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta on Sunday announced that the verified tag or the blue badge on Facebook and Instagram may get paid soon. This means that Meta Platforms is now testing a monthly subscription service called Meta Verified similar to Twitter verified, which is also now paid.

      As per the information available in the public domain, this paid Meta Verified service will let users verify their accounts using a government ID and get a blue tick, all at the payment of a small fee. The idea behind this, as per Meta, is to help content creators grow, build communities and even avoid impersonation.

      The Meta Verified is expected to be a subscription bundle for both Instagram and Facebook and will be launched later this week. The mentioned service will be priced starting at $11.99 per month on the web and is also expected to provide extra protection against impersonation.

      It must be noted that Meta Verified will first be launched in Australia and New Zealand this week and eventually, the service will be rolled out in other countries as well. Back then, even when Twitter launched its paid blue tick or Twitter Blue, the service was first launched in select countries and then eventually rolled out to others.`,

            SYDNEY, April 4 (Reuters) - Australia banned TikTok on Tuesday from all federal government-owned devices over security concerns, becoming the latest U.S.-allied country to take action against the Chinese-owned video app.

The ban underscores growing worries that China could use the Beijing-based company, owned by ByteDance Ltd, to harvest users' data to advance its political agenda, undermining Western security interests.

It also risks renewing diplomatic tension between Australia and its largest trading partner after things eased somewhat since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese took office in May at the head of a Labor government.

TikTok said it was extremely disappointed by Australia's decision, calling it "driven by politics, not by fact".

The ban will come into effect "as soon as practicable", Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said in a statement, adding that exemptions would only be granted on a case-by-case basis and with appropriate security measures in place.

With Australia's ban, all members of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network - which consists of Australia, Canada, the United States, Britain and New Zealand - have banned the app from government devices. France, Belgium and the European Commission have announced similar bans.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, in testimony before the U.S. Congress last month, repeatedly denied the app shares data or has connections with the Chinese Communist Party.

TikTok's Australia and New Zealand General Manager Lee Hunter said TikTok should not be singled out.

"There is no evidence to suggest that TikTok is in any way a security risk to Australians and should not be treated differently to other social media platforms," Hunter said in a statement.

The Australian newspaper late on Monday reported Albanese had agreed to the ban after a review by the Home Affairs department.

            Apple released the latest refreshes to its MacBook Pro laptops just last month, but a new deal has brought the 14-inch model down to $1,799 at Amazon and B&H. That's $150 off this configuration's typical going rate on Amazon, $200 off Apple's MSRP and the largest discount we've seen to date. B&H's listing says the deal is only scheduled to last through Tuesday. Note that only the Space Gray model is discounted.

            This deal applies to the entry-level 14-inch model, which includes a new M2 Pro chip with a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. The 14.2-inch Mini-LED display has a resolution of 3,024 x 1,964 and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling. There's a 1080p webcam inside an iPhone-style display notch, plus three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, a full-sized SD card slot, a MagSafe connector for charging and a headphone jack.

We gave the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro a review score of 92 back in January. Although that review was based on a higher-power configuration than this discounted model, the general benefits are the same here. The new MacBook Pro is essentially just a speed bump, but it remains a fast and sturdily-built notebook for power users. Its display is still superb, its keyboard and trackpad are still comfortable, its speakers are still top-notch and its battery life can still genuinely last beyond a full work day. On the flip side, the whole thing is still expensive (even with this discount) and hardly upgradeable, but that's a familiar story for Macs. This entry-level model also comes with a 67W charger, while the more expensive configurations include a faster 96W adapter in the box.

The one major upgrade here is the new chip. To be clear, this variant of the M2 Pro isn't worth the upgrade for most owners of the prior MacBook Pro, and its graphics performance is still clearly behind the M2 Max chip available in the pricier Pro models. Because of the way its NAND chips are configured, this entry-level model's storage performance is technically slower than the last entry-level 14-inch Pro as well.
